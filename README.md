Real-Time Doctor-Patient Conversation Summarizer
- This project is designed to record real-time doctor-patient conversations, transcribe them into text, and analyze the conversation using a Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM provides a summary of the conversation and extracts key insights such as symptoms, diagnosis, tests, medications, and follow-up advice.
